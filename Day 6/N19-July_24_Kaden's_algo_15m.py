# Given an array arr of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array with maximum sum.


# Example 1:

# Input:
# N = 5
# arr[] = {1,2,3,-2,5}
# Output:
# 9
# Explanation:
# Max subarray sum is 9
# of elements (1, 2, 3, -2, 5) which 
# is a contiguous subarray.
# Example 2:

# Input:
# N = 4
# arr[] = {-1,-2,-3,-4}
# Output:
# -1
# Explanation:
# Max subarray sum is -1 
# of element (-1)
